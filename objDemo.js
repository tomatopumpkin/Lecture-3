// How can you represent real-world objects in code?
// They have associated attributes = object PROPERTIES
// They have associated actions = onject METHODS
// They have associated context = "this"

// First:
// Let's defind a simple object (with no properties or methods)
const blank = {}
console.log("Blank type:",typeof blank)
console.log("Blank value",blank)

/*
// Next:
// Lets' define an object with PROPERTIES (attributes)
// Objects are just a collection of name-value pairs
// separated by commas
const book = {
    title   : "1984",
    author  : "George Orwell",
    isAvailable: false
}
